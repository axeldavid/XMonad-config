My XMonad & XMobar config
-------------------------

+ Running Ubuntu 11.10
+ In addition to ZSH and lots of goodies
+ No Gnome, no Unity, pure pleasure and eye candy!

+ The `xmonad.desktop` file goes into `/usr/share/xsessions/` folder.

TODO
====

+ Create a custom Exec script instead of running directly XMonad
  + Add custom startup programs there (mainly xscreensaver)
+ Add weather and network info to XMobar
